            <p>Major differnece between Library and Framework is “Inversion Control”. When you call a library control is yours. But with framework it is inverted, the framework calls you. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Library</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>A library is just a collection of class definitions.</p></li>
                        <li><p>It is designed for code reusability. It will get the code that has already been written by other developers</p></li>
                        <li><p>It is already developed. People who need this just call this library and get the result without any code implementation</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Framework</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Framework is just basic structure of a system. We need to implement specific functionality based on our requirement. </p></li>
                        <li><p>In other terms, All the control flow is already there. There is a bunch of predefined white spots that you should fill out with our code</p></li>
                        <li><p>Developers no need to worry about whether design is good or not but just about implementation of domain specific functions.</p></li>
